On Depression: “Trees aren’t supposed to display fruit; they’re supposed to produce it. As much as I wanted to see results, I knew that I had to wait. The tree had to become healthy and mature before it could produce the fruit, and that takes time.” If what you read resonates with you, this is the type of therapy I offer.

348,Greg Good,"Marriage & Family Therapist,LMFT",(619) 762-2908,Available online only,"I specialize in, Men's Issues, ,, Spirituality, and, Anxiety","We live in an increasingly isolated world in which we are convinced on all sides that connection, meaning, and value can be shipped, swiped-on, liked, and plugged in. Social Media's benefits have allowed for unprecedented world-wide connection, but often at the cost of the life experiences that cultivate self-knowledge, character, confidence, and purpose. This leaves many people feeling paradoxically lonely, anxious, depressed, and without a sense of meaning or direction. Regardless of what may be causing your distress, talking with a therapist can help.
Cognitive-Behavioral therapy helps explore and identify areas of your life that have become out of balance and uses modern techniques to empower you to respond more effectively.

If you're reading this, you're exploring the idea of trying something new, and you may be curious about how therapy can help.

In a glass house, however, you cannot conceal anything without giving yourself away, except by hiding it under the ground. And then you cannot see it yourself, either.”
On Depression: “Trees aren’t supposed to display fruit; they’re supposed to produce it. As much as I wanted to see results, I knew that I had to wait. The tree had to become healthy and mature before it could produce the fruit, and that takes time.” If what you read resonates with you, this is the type of therapy I offer.

I use my personal experience as a person who feels things (no robot therapist here) and has experienced trauma to help us both understand you.

I make mistakes - I have locked myself out of the office before a session.
It is this humanness that I bring to therapy. For some of my lovely clients, I am the only one they can share their humanity with because they have been shamed so long for not being perfect and having feelings and needs.  I am not going to tell you how you should feel or what you should do. Let's figure out what works for your life!
I love supporting people who have experienced trauma, attachment injuries from their past, imposter syndrome, anger, and anxiety. My style is to find out how to meet the needs of your emotions to help you work with (instead of against) how you feel and to help you nurture parts of you that were wounded by loved ones, society, and maybe even you.",$150
